The purpose of today’s meeting was to discuss temporary polling location changes for the 
February 28th Special Election.  Adrienne James, Deputy Director, stated she received an 
email from John Orzech at Sandusky City.  The city would like us to move the precinct 
Sandusky A to Cedar Point Express Hotel at 1201 Cedar Point Rd.  Cedar Point has 
granted us permission to use the hotel.  This would only be for the February election.  After 
that, Son Rise Marina should have their water main break fixed, and they can go back to 
hosting San A.  Ms. Crescimano motioned to make the change to the Cedar Point Hotel, 
with Mr. Monaghan seconding.  All board members voted yes; motion carried.  Ms. James 
stated she would contact Triad and ask them to send postcards to the effected voters.   
 
Next, Ms. James spoke regarding the Sandusky Cultural Center polling location.  She 
stated that we received an email from them Friday afternoon, saying they may not be able 
to host us due to a girls’ basketball game on election day.  We contacted Mr. Hinners, who 
suggested emailing them to ask them to reconsider.  Ms. James also noted that the Cultural 
Center does accept taxpayers’ dollars.  Director Lori Salyers emailed them, and they are 
now willing to work with us.  They also said they would order signs for parking.   
 
Mr. Monaghan made a motion to adjourn, with Ms. Crescimano seconding.  All board 
members voted yes; motion carried.  Board adjourned at 1:04 p.m.

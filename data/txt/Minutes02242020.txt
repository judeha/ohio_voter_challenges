Motion to accept Paula Ward’s resignation as deputy director was made by Mr. 
Krabill, seconded by Mr. Monaghan.  Motion carried.   
 
Motion to go into executive session was made by Mr. Monaghan, seconded by Mr. 
Krabill.  Motion passed.  The board went into executive session at 8:07 a.m.  
 
Motion to come out of executive session was made by Mr. Monaghan, seconded by Mr. 
Krabill.  Motion passed.  The board came out of executive session at 8:30 a.m.  
 
Mr. Krabill made a motion to increase the pay of the part-time office workers.  For 
Mr. Barnum and the woman who was hired to temporarily replace Ms. Ward, he 
motioned that their pay increase to $12.50 an hour.  For the other part-time office 
workers, he motioned for their pay to increase to $10.00 an hour.  For both raises, 
though, Mr. Krabill indicated that it should be conditional on approval from the 
prosecutor’s office.  Mr. Monaghan seconded the motion.  Mr. Smith then asked for 
clarification regarding the woman who was hired to temporarily replace Ms. Ward.  
He wanted to clarify that this woman was not being hired as a deputy director, but was 
simply being hired to fill in some temporary gaps that arose when Ms. Ward resigned.  
The other board members reassured Mr. Smith that that was the case.  A vote was 
then taken, and the motion for the pay increases passed.   
 
The board then discussed posting for the deputy director job.  It needs to be posted in 
the Sandusky Register, on the county website, and on the Secretary of State website.  
Motion to post the opening from February 27 through March 6 was made by Mr. 
Krabill, seconded by Mr. Monaghan.  Motion passed.  
 
Director’s Report 
 
Ms. Salyers, director, stated that she gave a copy of the homeland security assessment 
to each board member.  Homeland Security recommends the office have one or two 
full-time I.T. staff.  Ms. Salyers stated that we do not have enough to keep two full-time 
I.T. people busy, but that we do need one.  She also stated that hiring an I.T. person 
would come out of the budget, and that the commissioners do not want the county I.T. 
department to assist us.  Mr. Smith stated that the commissioners want the office to 
contract out the position.  Ms. Salyers and Mr. Krabill both wanted to see how much 
an external contractor would cost versus hiring someone in the county, because that 
might help us make our case to the budget people.  Mr. Monaghan suggested 
contacting neighboring county board of elections to see how they are handling it.  Mr. 
Krabill stated that he spoke to a commissioner regarding our situation.  Mr. Krabill 
also suggested sharing an I.T. person with several neighboring counties, because that 
might be more palatable to the commissioners and the budget people.  Mr. Monaghan 
agreed.  Mr. Smith asked where in the assessment it recommends having one to two 
full-time I.T. staff.  It is possible that the recommendation is not in the assessment, but 
in the report, which no one has seen yet.  Mr. Smith stated it would be a good idea to 
have the report to give to the commissioners to help make our case.  Mr. Smith then 
asked at 8:40 a.m. to be excused, because he had to go to court.

Ms. Salyers then asked the board about training for poll workers.  Chapter two of the 
election officials’ manual states that poll workers only have to go through training 
every three years if they have worked before.  Ms. James stated that she and Ms. Link 
felt that every three years was too big a gap because things change, but that training 
once every calendar year seemed acceptable.  Mr. Ferrell stated that he thought that 
would be fine.  Mr. Krabill stated his only concern was the poll workers pointing to the 
language in the election officials’ manual, which states “every three years.”  Ms. James 
stated that the manual said “every three years, or as determined by the Secretary of 
State or the Board.”  Mr. Krabill then made a motion that training be required 
annually for poll workers.  Mr. Monaghan seconded the motion.  Motion passed.  
 
Ms. Salyers stated the last item she needed to go over was Mucci Farms.  She received 
a call from someone at the census bureau who was concerned because Mucci Farms is 
part of Huron City, but that the Mucci Farms address is within a Huron Township 
voting precinct.  Mr. Ferrell pointed out that Huron City and Huron Township have a 
weird relationship.  As an example, Huron City pays for fire trucks that are housed in 
Huron Township.  Mr. Krabill inquired as to what exactly the census people wanted us 
to do.  Ms. Salyers stated that they wanted to know why, if Mucci Farms is in Huron 
City, it is assigned to a Huron Township voting precinct.  Mr. Ferrell stated that it was 
this way because of a TIFF agreement between Huron City and Huron Township.  Ms. 
Salyers stated she would contact the person from the census bureau and let him know 
this.   
 
Meeting was adjourned at 8:53 a.m.

Deputy Director Brooks gave the board the Power Point presentation of the new 
Voter ID laws. A discussion was had regarding the presentation. The Board 
requested that we get input from Assistant Prosecutor Zach West and the Ohio 
Secretary of State regarding this presentation before we start using this 
presentation as an office. 
Helen King from the League of Women Voters asked if our office would like to 
have a representative at a Local Candidate Forum Panel to help give information 
on how to file for a local office. The board decided not to have a representative 
attend due to a concern that misconstrued information could be passed along 
outside the forum. Information including the Local Candidate Guide and other 
resources from the Ohio Secretary of State were offered for their use.

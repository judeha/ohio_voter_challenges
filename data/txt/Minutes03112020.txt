Ms. Salyers, Director, stated that a new directive came from the Secretary of State 
yesterday, stating that any polling places that house the elderly have to be moved due 
to public health concerns.  Ms. Salyers, Mr. Krabill, and Ms. James drove around to 
different locations yesterday, trying to figure out where to move the polling locations in 
Erie County that house the elderly.  They decided to move the Commons of Providence 
polling location, SAN P, over to the Sandusky City Service Complex, which already 
houses the precinct SAN O.  For the Ohio Veterans Home, which is PER TWP #5, they 
decided to move that to the basement of the Erie County Services Center, which 
already houses the precinct PER TWP #4.  They also decided to move the polling place 
at the Senior Center, because even though that does not house the elderly, there are a 
lot of elderly folks going in and out of that building.  The Senior Center polling place, 
which is for the precinct SAN G, will be moved to the old Sandusky municipal building 
on Meigs Street.  Ms. Salyers stated that she already made signs to post at the 
entrances of the Commons, the OVH, and the Senior Center, letting people know about 
the temporary changes and apologizing for the inconvenience.  She also stated that she 
updated our system to reflect the changes with the help of Jose from Triad.  Triad is 
also sending out postcards to all the voters that have been affected, letting them know 
about the temporary changes.  Triad is also updating our website with the changes.   
 
Ms. Salyers stated that the cost of having Triad send out the postcards was 5 cents per 
card, plus the cost of postage.  She figured that this was a good price, and since we do 
not have the extra man-hours for us in the office to send out cards, it was a good idea 
for Triad to do it.  She also stated that the Secretary of State might partially reimburse 
us for these expenses.  Mr. Krabill stated that the Secretary of State office has been 
flexible, and so has Chief Orzech and others from the city of Sandusky when we had to 
move polling locations so quickly.   
 
Ms. Salyers stated that right now, we have all of our poll workers lined up, but that 
that could change.  Mr. Krabill then stated that with the OVH, we probably didnâ€™t 
have to move that location, because it is a self-contained precinct.  The only people who 
vote there are the residents, and the only people coming in from the outside are the 
four poll workers.  However, the directive stated that we still had to move it.  Ms. 
Salyers stated that she had been in touch with Naomi Twine at the OVH, and that we 
are trying to get as many of the residents as possible to vote absentee.   
 
Mr. Smith inquired if we needed to vote on moving the three precincts, and the board 
members agreed that it was a good idea.  Mr. Smith made the motion to move the 
precincts, seconded by Mr. Monaghan.  Motion carried.  
 
Mr. Krabill stated that we purchased Clorox wipes for all the polling locations so that 
the poll workers can wipe down surfaces.  He also stated that we are in the process of 
acquiring hand sanitizer for all the polling locations.  As for the poll pads, Ms. Salyers 
stated that we could use rubbing alcohol for them, and that she had already made up 
signs instructing the poll workers not to use the Clorox wipes for the poll pads, because 
the excess liquid could damage the pads.  She also stated that the Secretary of State 
would reimburse us for the cleaning supplies.

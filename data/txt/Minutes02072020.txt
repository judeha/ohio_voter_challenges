The purpose for todayâ€™s meeting is to talk about the updated training quote.  We need 
to have this meeting to expend the funds because we cannot do it over the phone.  
 
We have a quote for $3,468 and this is for training for everyone.  We have poll worker 
training classes, but when the employees are not teaching class, they will be included in 
the training.   
 
Mr. Krabill motioned to approve the TRIAD training, seconded by Mr. Monaghan.  
Motion carried.  
 
Mr. Krabill inquired from a staff point of view, how are things going? 
 
Ms. Salyers stated there has been a lot thrown at her and she will need some 
clarification on her duties.  She does not want to overstep her bounds.  
 
Mr. Smith inquired if Ms. Salyers is in the mentorship program, and Ms. Salyers 
started no.  Mr. Smith stated that we all should have someone that has worked at a 
Board of Elections to contact.  
 
Mr. Smith inquired if everyone was going to attend for the next meeting.  He 
mentioned that we might need to reschedule the next meeting, as he will be out of town.  
Mr. Krabill stated that he will also be out of town.

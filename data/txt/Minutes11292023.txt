conducted the post-election audit.  
 
At 12:12 p.m., the board reconvened with all members present except Ms. McKeen.   
 
Adrienne James, Deputy Director, reviewed the results of the post-election audit.  Staff 
audited two voting machines: the scanner at Zion Lutheran Church, which hosts Sandusky 
H and I, and the scanner at Ritter Public Library, which hosts Vermilion 1-A, 2-A, and 2-
B.  The three races audited were State Issue 1, State Issue 2, and Issue 11, which was a 
county-wide levy for the Erie County General Health District.  The numbers from the staff 
hand count match perfectly with the numbers from the voting machines.  The board 
members, director, and deputy director signed the audit certification form to submit to the 
Secretary of Stateâ€™s office.   
 
Ms. Crescimano motioned to adjourn, with Ms. Groot seconding.  All board members

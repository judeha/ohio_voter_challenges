Motion to go back into regular session was made by Mr. Smith, seconded by Mr. 
Krabill.  Motion carried.  Board returned to regular session at 3:25 p.m.  
 
Mr. Smith motioned to hire Lori Salyers as new Director under our standard 
conditions, 6 monthsâ€™ probationary period, along with passing the requirements of the 
job.  Motion seconded by Mr. Krabill.   
 
Open for discussion. 
 
Mr. Monaghan inquired why Lori would be a good candidate?  Mr. Krabill stated Lori 
punches the list on most everything.  She has worked in another office; she has worked 
with other people, unblemished record, and deals with the public on a regular basis.  
She works in a very public arena.  She has the requisite computer skills, and is well 
spoken.  Again, she has no Board of Elections experience but has worked for this office 
as a poll worker and did so for a number of years.  Lori stated she has wanted to work 
for the BOE for some time, but has never had the opportunity.   
 
Mr. Ferrell inquired if the board members kept score for her interview?  Mr. Smith 
said they scored her at a twelve.   
 
Mr. Monaghan stated that Lori looked good on paper.  Director Ferback stated that 
she has applied for positions before but they were Democratic positions and she is a 
Republican.   
 
Mr. Gross suggested if we have any further discussion in detail, that we may want to go 
back into executive session.  General discussion is fine.  
 
Mr. Smith stated that she is experienced in training people, which is another benefit. 
 
Roll called.  
 
Mr. Ferrell-no, Mr. Krabill-yes, Mr. Monaghan-yes, Mr. Smith-yes.  Motion passed.  
 
Mr. Ferrell stated to start the new hire paperwork.  
 
Director Ferback estimated that Lori may be able to start by January 28th based on 
her two week notice to her current employer and on getting the new hire testing 
completed and back.  
 
Motion to adjourn was made by Mr. Krabill, seconded by Mr. Smith.  Motion carried.  
 
Meeting adjourned at 3:35 p.m.

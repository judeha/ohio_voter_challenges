Ms. James stated that there were two issues to certify, a tax levy for Margaretta Township 
and a tax levy for Castalia Village.  Ms. James also stated that the office reviewed the 
paperwork turned in by the subdivisions.  Motion to certify the issues was made by Mr.

Motion carried.   
 
Next, Ms. James stated that Dennis Schreiner turned in paperwork to run for Republican 
Central Committee in Groton Township.  However, Mr. Schreiner is a registered 
Democrat, because he voted a Democratic ballot in the 2020 primary.  Ms. Salyers and Ms. 
James consulted with the SOS legal department, who informed them that Mr. Schreiner 
cannot run.  They cited the relevant portions of the Elections Officials Manual and the 
O.R.C.  In addition, Jason Hinners at the Prosecutor’s Office composed an email which 
explained why Mr. Schreiner cannot run for this office.  Mr. Smith asked if no one runs for 
Groton Township Republican Central Committee, and Mr. Schreiner votes a Republican 
ballot, if he could be appointed after the election.  Ms. James stated yes.   
 
Motion to reject Mr. Schreiner’s paperwork and to inform him that if he votes Republican 
in this primary, he could later be appointed, was made by Mr. Smith, seconded by Mr. 
Monaghan.  Motion carried.   
 
Next on the agenda was polling location updates.  Ms. James reminded the board members 
of the challenges we faced at the Sandusky Cultural Center polling location last November.  
She stated that she started an email conversation with Dennis Muratori, the assistant 
superintendent, and that he seems ready and willing to work with us.   
 
Lori Salyers, Director, then gave updates on the Ohio Veterans Home and Vermilion.  She 
stated that she spoke with Naomi Twine of the OVH, and they would like to continue to do 
absentee voting.  Ms. Salyers stated she would make up a packet of absentee ballot 
applications and give it to Ms. Twine to disperse at the OVH.  Mr. Smith asked if the 
residents wanted to vote in the basement of the county building on Election Day, if they 
could, and Ms. Salyers responded yes.  Mr. Smith also stated that Ms. Twine did a great 
job last year.   
 
Ms. Salyers then stated that she spoke with James Forthofer, the mayor of Vermilion, 
about possibly moving the Vermilion Field House Polling Location.  Mr. Forthofer 
informed her that there was nowhere else for the city to place us.  He stated that the new 
firehouse would not work, because that would possibly interfere with rescue services.  
Therefore, we are going to have to stay at the Field House.   
 
Eliza Link, clerk, commented that last November, we had trouble with the heat at the Field 
House, and it didn’t turn on until 3 or 4 p.m.  Mr. Smith stated we would need to talk to the 
superintendent about that.  Mr. Krabill asked if we had one of their custodians on our 
payroll on Election Day.  Ms. James confirmed that we did.  Ms. Salyers stated that we 
received some complaints about the field house being difficult to navigate during school 
drop off and pick up times.

Next, Ms. James spoke about the possibility of poll workers switching parties, and asked 
the board members how they would like us to handle that.  Mr. Smith stated that it’s his 
understanding that it’s the staff members’ discretion which poll workers they hire.  He 
stated to go back to the workers who have worked for you for a long time.  He also stated to 
consider if you have ever had any problems with these poll workers, and to consider if you 
have enough poll workers.  Mr. Ferrell stated as long as we strive to keep parity between 
the R’s and D’s, that’s the main thing.  Mr. Krabill added that people may want to switch 
parties, but they do not officially switch until they have voted in the primary.  He stated 
that if they vote early and you know what their new party is, use that as your guiding light.   
 
The next item on the agenda was a discussion of pay for poll workers.  Kimberly Barnum, 
clerk, spoke on the possibility of raising poll worker training pay for back up poll workers.  
Currently, we pay our poll workers a training rate, but then, if they quit, that rate drops.  
For example, a VLM earns $30 for training, but if they quit, that drops down to $15.  
Currently we pay our back up poll workers the same amount as our quitters, but Ms. 
Barnum was wondering if we could increase the backups’ training pay to the full amount.  
She noted that even if they do not work, they are still on call up to the morning of Election 
Day.  She also noted that backups must be willing to work anywhere in the county.   
 
Mr. Smith asked about how much we are talking.  Ms. Barnum replied 20 backups, with an 
increase of $15 for each one, so that would be $300.  Mr. Smith replied that he thinks that is 
in our budget.  Mr. Monaghan stated increasing the training pay of back up workers was 
“good insurance.”  Mr. Smith agreed.  Motion to pay the back up poll workers the full 
training amount was made by Mr. Smith, seconded by Mr. Monaghan.  Motion carried.  
Mr. Smith thanked Ms. Barnum for bringing this pay discrepancy to the attention of the 
board.   
 
Next, Ms. Link spoke about pay for ride-backs.  She mentioned that on Election Night, we 
have a bipartisan team bring back all the supplies and ballots.  However, the ride-backs are 
hard to recruit because there is no pay incentive.  The VLM who is with the ride-back is 
paid extra, though.  Ms. Link suggested offering a $10 incentive for the ride-backs.  We 
have 38 locations and 38 ride-backs, so that would be an extra $380.  Ms. Salyers 
mentioned that in Lorain County, they pay their ride-backs an extra $60.   
 
Mr. Monaghan suggested adjusting ride-back pay based on mileage.  Mr. Ferrell stated he 
thinks the increased pay for ride-backs is a good idea for keeping poll workers.  Mr. Smith 
then made a motion to increase the ride-back pay by $10.  He stated that Mr. Monaghan’s 
idea to adjust ride-back pay by miles would be too complicated.  Mr. Monaghan seconded 
Mr. Smith’s motion.  Motion carried.   
 
Ms. Link then stated, before we move on, she just wanted to clarify something regarding 
training pay.  The increased training pay would not be for poll workers who trained and 
then quit.  The board members stated they understood.   
 
Next, Ms. James stated we needed to reschedule the February board meeting.  Currently 
we have it scheduled for February 25th; however, according to the SOS Election Calendar, 
boards must certify petitions and issues by February 14th.  After some discussion, the board 
members decided to move the meeting to Friday, February 11th at 9 a.m.  Ms. James stated 
she would revise the schedule and update the website.   
 
Next on the agenda was “any other matters to come before the board.”  Ms. Grubbe stated 
she had some questions about the report that Mr. Krabill recently wrote.  She wanted to 
know if Mr. Krabill wrote the report on behalf of the board, and what was in it.  Mr.

she had some questions about the report that Mr. Krabill recently wrote.  She wanted to 
know if Mr. Krabill wrote the report on behalf of the board, and what was in it.  Mr. 
Krabill stated some people approached him who thought the 2020 election was somehow 
altered or changed, so he looked into it.  Ms. Grubbe asked if the board approved it.  Mr. 
Smith responded that Mr. Krabill wrote the report on his own.  It was not presented to the 
board for adoption or approval.  Ms. Grubbe then stated she would like a copy of the 
report.  Mr. Krabill stated he would email it to her.
